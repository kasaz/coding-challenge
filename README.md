# Coding challenge: Apartments search
* Create a simple page to search for apartments. Here's one example of how it could look like (including bonus features):

* An apartment should have:
  - title
  - price
  - sqm
  - number of bedrooms
  - number of bathrooms
  - picture
* Add filters for the search: per price, per sqm, per # of bedroomsâ€¦ 
* Bonus points! (not mandatory)
  - Add a left menu you can toggle in/out
  - Infinite scrolling: When scrolling to the en of the apartments list, it automaticaly loads more apartments

## Technology and instructions:
* Backend: Ruby on Rails
* Frontend: React or React Native
* **Important**: Build some unit testing on the frontend and backend.
* Use git, upload it to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/etc or send us the code including the .git folder,
* We should be able to see your entire commit history, not just a dump.
* Add a small setup guide to test the app locally. I would be awesome if you use Docker/Docker Compose.
* Expected delivery time is one week. Please let us know if you need more time.

Do contact us for any question, comment or clarification. Good luck and have fun!
